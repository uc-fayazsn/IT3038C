To run the CARBON python script. Navigate to the path in Powershell, or whichever CLI you are using.
cd C:\~whereever it is\
You can type the entire .ps1 file name here and it will work, or from any directly path directly to it
C:\IT3038C\powershell\CARBON.ps1 -- will load the file. 

From here there are 3 tests using the Carbon module:

1) check if your OS is 64-bit or not, it is a Y/N answer
2) writing a directory in the IT3038C drive directly
3) Testing a windows feature, in this case the IIS-Server.
