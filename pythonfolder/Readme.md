This calculator is given two values input by the user and then applies whichever functionality of their choosing.
The types of functions are:

#+ for addition
#- for subtraction
#* for multiplication
#/ for division
#** for exponentials
#% for remainder/modulus
#// for floor division


Addition will add the two inputs together (inputOne + inputTwo)
Subtractions will subtract the two inputs (inputOne - inputTwo)
Multiplcation will multiply the two inputs (inputOne * inputTwo)
Division will divide the two inputs. (inputOne / inputTwo)
Exponentials will perform their exponentials with the two inputs (inputOne ** inputTwo)
Modulus will provide the remainder of the two functions (inputOne % inputTwo)
Floor Division returns the integral part of the division (inputOne // inputTwo)


#division functions
the division functions have an error reporting if the second value (denominator) is a zero as the value is then undefined.

#import time
Time has been imported to allow the sleep function to occur after the welcome message and before the calculations begin.


#updateLog
Welcome message with a log of whats been added since project 1 was turned in.
